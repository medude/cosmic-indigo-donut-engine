Changes:
-Removed of the testing classes
-Changed the directory structure, and thus
-Changed package declarations and imports
-Made the ParseException class extend IOException instead of RuntimeException
-Modified the JsonParser class to have more methods throw different exceptions, and integrated the Cosmic Indigo error handler.
-Auto code formating
